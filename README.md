# Movie-Cost-Revenue-Prediction-Linear-Regressio
In this project we will be working with a Movie cost and revenue data set, Which has cost for movie production and gross amount earned in dollars. We will try to create a linear regression model that will predict the gross earned value of a movie based on cost spent on movie production. 

This data set contains the following features:

- ___'production_budget_usd'___: Movie production project in dollars. It will be our X variable or Feature variable.
- ___'worldwide_gross_usd'___: Wordwide gross amount earned in rupees after movie release. It will be our target variable.


### Project Objectives:

- Prepare a detailed python notebook using Linear Regression for predicting gross earned value based on movie production cost 
= Visualize the dataset.
- Plot graphs between various features to establish trends in data.
- Split up the data between training and testing set accordingly.
- Train the Linear Regression Model on "training" set.
- Evaluate the Model on "testing" set.
